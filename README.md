### Continued development

I had a difficult time working with the layout. Some of the layouts were achieved with absolute position. As a result, they did not respond the way I wanted them when I minimized the page. I went ahead and decided to leave this project as is. The optimal view here is at 1000px, anything smaller then that the page starts to break. I plan to revisit this project in the future when I get a better understanding of grid box, as I know you can overlay items. I was able to do this with the mid-container background, second pattern, and also the phone image. However, once I started adding other images, grid started acting odd, therefore I opted to absolute position the orange container, which lead to problems with responsiveness. Overall, I am happy with the desktop view.
